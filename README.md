## Hey! Welcome to my profile.

I'm currently a junior studying Computer Science at CSUSB. My interests are currently centered around the use of AI as a tool for creating interactive experiences and conducting research about all sorts of topics! 
Hopefully in the future I'll be pursuing a PhD in Human-computer interaction. 

Do check out my website if you've got the time!
